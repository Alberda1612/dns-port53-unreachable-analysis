# DNS Server Unavailability: Investigating UDP Port 53 Unreachable Error
![](network.jpg)

## Introduction
The DNS Port 53 Unreachable Analysis project is a comprehensive investigation into a specific network issue encountered while accessing a website. The repository provides detailed logs and network captures. This is used to analyze the DNS and ICMP traffic, aiming to identify the underlying problem causing the unavailability of the DNS server.

## Objectives
1. Identify the affected network protocol: Determine which network protocol (e.g., UDP, TCP) is causing the "UDP port 53 unreachable" error, leading to the DNS server unavailability.
2. Analyze DNS and ICMP traffic: Utilize network analyzer tools (e.g., tcpdump) to capture and analyze the DNS and ICMP packets, examining the source, destination IP addresses, timestamps, and error messages.
3. Determine the root cause: Investigate the logs and network captures to identify the underlying issue causing the unavailability of the DNS server, such as misconfigurations, network blocks, or potential malicious activities.
